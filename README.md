# Express.js - Missing or Incorrect Content-Type Header in JSON Request

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications where JSON request bodies are not parsed correctly due to missing or incorrect `Content-Type` headers.

## Bug Description
The Express.js application fails to parse the JSON request body when the `Content-Type` header is missing or set incorrectly.  The `req.body` object remains empty, causing unexpected behavior and application errors.

## Solution
Ensure the client sends the correct `Content-Type: application/json` header with the request.  You can add middleware to handle cases where the header is missing or incorrect, such as parsing the body manually or returning a more descriptive error message.
